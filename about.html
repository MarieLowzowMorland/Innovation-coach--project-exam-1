          <h2>What is this blog all about?</h2>
          <p>
            This blog is centred  around helping good ideas come alive.
            A good idea has no value without action, but people with great
            ideas don't necessarily know where to start. Even though this blog is not a recipe, 
            it is a place where you can get inspired and learn about some good tools and techniques.
            Hopefully the articles here will act as nourishment for your idea to grow, 
            and help you get started on your path to make it a reality. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe you don’t have an idea at all? Reading this blog, you'll learn that 
            many great innovations started with problems that someone found out how they could handle. 
            There are still plenty of problems left to handle in this world, and maybe 
            one of my articles will help you discover one that you'll be able to solve. 
            I imagine that the world will be a better place the more problems we'll be able to fix,
            and with this site I hope to equip you with some of the skills required to succeed 
            with the problem you'd like to solve.
          </p>
          <p>
            By reading the posts you'll learn about how to come up with ideas, 
            tools to validate them, how to get your first customer and build a good business model.
            The techniques will help you develop both your products and business, 
            and are based on well-established theories and proven methodology from
            i.e. Google ventures design sprint, Sarasvati's effectuation, 
            Books my renowned authors such as Erik Rice, Osterwalder and Steve Blanks 
            to mention a few. Look around, and feel free to fill in a contact form if

          <h2>Who I am</h2>
          <p>
            I´m Marie. Currently <span id="myage">31</span> years old and live in Oslo 
            with my husband, my wonderful daughter, and my little son. I have a master’s 
            degree in architecture, and run my own business while I also worked several years
            at the University of Oslo as a lecturer in entrepreneurship and innovation. 
            I've also held courses in i.e., Design Thinking at Westerdals, and done several 
            censorship in both this and related subjects. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During the corona-time with home office, 
            I got a glimpse of how it is to work as a developer through my husband. Even though I’d 
            played with the idea of learning a programming language before, that was when I decided 
            that I would enjoy working as a developer, and especially the front-end part of programming. 
            Thus, my revised plan is to create good user experiences on web
            rather than through buildings, and take part in exciting digitalization processes 
            along with cross-functional teams.
